## Section 1 - Primer Challenges


For Ada's advanced programming module, the introduction of C++ and completion of 10 primer challenges using this programming language was calibrated. The C++ general-purpose language contains rules such as declaring the data type of a variable. In addtion, the most used features each primer included were loops, conditions, and functions. The features ensured less effective runtime bugs occurred in the code. The primers were solved differently in regards to the example output. Initially, pseudocode was issued and implemented with C++ and a standard library.  Moreover, code refactoring was the last step to complete a primer. This step provided clarity towards the code. 



### Primer 1 - Fahrenheit / Centigrade Conversion
This challenge required the user to enter a value before selecting whether to convert the number from Fahrenheit to Centigrade or Centigrade to Fahrenheit. The extension task for including Kelvin in the conversion was also incorporated. As part of the initial design, the conversion algorithms were needed for both calculations.  

####To help complete this challenge I needed to break the overall problem down into the following main tasks: 
* Get data from the user
* Verify the data is in a suitable format
* The user input has to be a float
* Create a method to convert F->C
* Create a method to convert C->F
* Create a method to convert K->C
* Create a method to convert K->F
* A while loop to repeat the question after user input 

 
### Reflection (as well as issues, challenges & resolutions)

The layout of the primer took into evaluation the steps of the example output. The layout included a precision of words outputted to the console and correct temperature conversions. Furthermore, the conversions calculations were contained inside a function with parameters of the desired value a user would input and a calculation would occur in that particular function. During refactoring, four functions for temperature conversions were created to improve the clarity of the code. As previous code revisions , included one function for a Fahrenheit conversion and the other for a Centigrade conversion. However, this made the code less easy to read and caused further bugs to develop. Therefore, further functions made the C++ code more effective due to less runtime bugs. 

The biggest issue related to testing the areas my solution failed. I tested to see if it worked - however, it wasnâ€™t until I tried to break it that I found some issues with my pseudocode implementation. For example, the user input variable had to a data type called float. This data type can hold in memory 4 bytes of data in regards to a decimal. However, if a user entered a string, the console would display an error. As a result, the method of stof() was added to the code. This method was effective as the user could not enter a string. As a result, the console instructed the user to enter a correct value. 


Although using namespace std is not recommended, as a beginner to C++, I wanted to focus on the fundamentals of loops, functions and variables conventions. For future reference, the using namespace with will be removed in later practice and assigned with :

* using std:: cout; 
* std:: cin;
* std:: string; 

As std:: uses the whole standard library, this would arise the possibility for a naming conflict to occur in an upgraded C++ version.

## Section 2 - Programming Paradigms
### Programming Paradigms
Simply put, a programming paradigm, for example, procedural, object-oriented, functional, structured, declarative, imperative and event driven can be described as a specific approach used when trying to solve a problem.  Although many programming languages can (and do) support multiple paradigms this discussion will focus more specifically on the possible benefits with examples of the potential differences and similarities of five from the above list. These are ...
